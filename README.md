a visual novel + minigame i made during gwc (made with p5.js and p5.play) but never got around to fully completing it, now the maze game is fully working! 

you help a teddy bear find her way home by making choices and playing a maze game!

i coded in VS Code and tested on Replit, used p5.js for visuals and p5.play for sprites

the playable link is: https://miyahope.github.io/vn-game/

for some reason its was not loading on vs code which has been quite annoying since i've had to paste my code back and forth from vs code to replit preview to see if it works. but now somehow it is <3
