a visual novel game i made during gwc but never got around to fully completing it, now the maze game is fully working! 

for some reason its not loading on vs code which has been quite annoying since i've had to paste my code back and forth from vs code to replit preview to see if it works.

so the playable link is: https://replit.com/@miyahope/vn-game
